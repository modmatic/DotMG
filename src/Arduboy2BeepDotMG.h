/** \brief
 * Play simple square wave tones using speaker channel 1.
 *
 * \note
 * Class `BeepChan2` provides identical functions for playing tones on speaker
 * channel 2. Both classes can be used in the same sketch to allow playing
 * two tones at the same time. To do this, the `begin()` and `timer()`
 * functions of both classes must be used.
 *
 * \details
 * This class can be used to play square wave tones on speaker channel 1.
 * The functions are designed to produce very small and efficient code.
 *
 * A tone can be set to play for a given duration, or continuously until
 * stopped or replaced by a new tone. The program continues to run while a
 * tone is playing. A small amount of code is required to time and stop a
 * tone after a given duration.
 *
 * Although there's no specific code to handle mute control, the
 * `Arduboy2Audio` class will work since it has code to mute sound by setting
 * the speaker pin to input mode and unmute by setting the pin as an output.
 * The `BeepChan1` class doesn't interfere with this operation.
 *
 * The duration of tones is timed by calling the `timer()` function continuously
 * at a fixed interval. The duration of a tone is given by specifying the number
 * of times `timer()` will be called before stopping the tone.
 *
 * For sketches that use `Arduboy2::nextFrame()`, or some other method to
 * generate frames at a fixed rate, `timer()` can be called once per frame.
 * Tone durations will then be given as the number of frames to play the tone
 * for. For example, with a rate of 60 frames per second a duration of 30
 * would be used to play a tone for half a second.
 *
 * The variable named `#duration` is the counter that times the duration of a
 * tone. A sketch can determine if a tone is currently playing by testing if
 * the `#duration` variable is non-zero (assuming it's a timed tone, not a
 * continuous tone).
 *
 * To keep the code small and efficient, the frequency of a tone is specified
 * by the actual count value to be loaded into to timer/counter peripheral.
 * The frequency will be determined by the count provided and the clock rate
 * of the timer/counter. In order to allow a tone's frequency to be specified
 * in hertz (cycles per second) the `freq()` helper function is provided,
 * which converts a given frequency to the required count value.
 *
 * All members of the class are static, so it's not necessary to create an
 * instance of the class in order to use it. However, creating an instance
 * doesn't produce any more code and it may make the source code smaller and
 * make it easier to switch to the `BeepChan2` class if it becomes necessary.
 *
 * The following is a basic example sketch, which will generate a tone when
 * a button is pressed.
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * #include <Arduboy2DotMG.h>
 * #include <Arduboy2BeepDotMG.h>
 *
 * Arduboy2 arduboy;
 * BeepChan1 beep; // class instance for speaker channel 1
 *
 * void setup() {
 *   arduboy.begin();
 *   arduboy.setFrameRate(50);
 *   beep.begin(); // set up the hardware for playing tones
 * }
 *
 * void loop() {
 *   if (!arduboy.nextFrame()) {
 *     return;
 *   }
 *
 *   beep.timer(); // handle tone duration
 *
 *   arduboy.pollButtons();
 *
 *   if (arduboy.justPressed(A_BUTTON)) {
 *     // play a 1000Hz tone for 100 frames (2 seconds at 50 FPS)
 *     // beep.freq(1000) is used to convert 1000Hz to the required count
 *     beep.tone(beep.freq(1000), 100);
 *   }
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \see BeepChan2

  /** \brief
   * The counter used by the `timer()` function to time the duration of a tone.
   *
   * \details
   * This variable is set by the `dur` parameter of the `tone()` function.
   * It is then decremented each time the `timer()` function is called, if its
   * value isn't 0. When `timer()` decrements it to 0, a tone that is playing
   * will be stopped.
   *
   * A sketch can determine if a tone is currently playing by testing if
   * this variable is non-zero (assuming it's a timed tone, not a continuous
   * tone).
   *
   * Example:
   * \code{.cpp}
   * beep.tone(beep.freq(1000), 15);
   * while (beep.duration != 0) { } // wait for the tone to stop playing
   * \endcode
   *
   * It can also be manipulated directly by the sketch, although this should
   * seldom be necessary.
